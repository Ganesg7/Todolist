        <p style="font-size: larger; color:rgb(10, 10, 10); font-weight: bolder;">The definition is a simple one.
             It's a list of tasks you need to complete, or things that you want to do.
              Most typically, they're organised in order of priority.
             Traditionally, they're written on a piece of paper or post it notes and acts as a memory aid.</p>

                    It lets you make large and overwhelming projects manageable. 
Also, you get more done by focusing on high-value activities. 
Once you have a list of things you need to-do, it's much easier to prioritize the tasks on it.
 This will ensure you're always working on the right things.
